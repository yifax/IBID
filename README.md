# Welcome to the Webpage of Project IBID
## Interaction between Intelligent Devices Project

### Project Summary 
The goal of this project is to build a autopilot following algorithm, which the later car could auto run basing on the infomation shared from the bellwether car. We are going to built at least two car for demo. The first one will run like a normal vehicle while the second one will have no other source but the infomation shared from the first car.

### Approach
Car 1: 
Mode 1:driven by human 
Mode 2: self-driving

Car 2:
No sensor,Interaction with Car 1(get the environment information from Car 1)
Navigated by car 1

Information share system:
Dynamic system(dynamic obstacle)
Path planning optimization algorithm

### Rough Timeline
Week4 to Week5     Construction of intelligent car

Week6 to Week7     Inplement interaction between two cars 

Week8 to Week9     Inplement interatcion between three cars 

Week10             Testing and demo
